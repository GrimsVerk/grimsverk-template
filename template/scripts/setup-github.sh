# setup-github.sh — turn the README's manual GitHub setup into one run.
#
#     scripts/setup-github.sh [options]
#
# Plain shell on purpose, next to update-from-template.sh and for the same
# reason: setup is needed regardless of which agent or editor you use, so it
# does not live under .claude/ and depends on nothing vendor-specific.
#
# WHAT IT DOES, idempotently — every step reads before it writes, so re-running
# after a partial failure finishes the job instead of duplicating it:
#
#   1. creates the GitHub repository if this project has no origin, and pushes;
#   2. sets the merge settings (allow auto-merge, allow merge commits, delete
#      branches on merge);
#   3. sets the secrets that are missing, prompting for each value silently —
#      a value never appears in an argument list, a log, or an echo;
#   4. creates (or updates) the `grimsverk-gates` ruleset: active on the
#      default branch, deletions and force-pushes blocked, pull request
#      required with 0 approvals plus Code Owners review, and the required
#      status checks for this project's language. Deliberately NOT "require
#      linear history" — it blocks merge commits, which breaks the one-line
#      `git revert -m 1` rollback the whole auto-merge design leans on.
#
# WHAT STAYS MANUAL, and each for a security reason rather than a missing
# feature:
#
#   - typing the secret VALUES. This script never fetches or stores a
#     credential; `claude setup-token` is an interactive OAuth flow, and the
#     two PATs are minted by a human in the GitHub UI because token minting is
#     a credential decision no script should make;
#   - creating the GitHub App (--app prints the exact URL and permission list;
#     the creation form itself is a click-through GitHub offers no API for);
#   - `gh auth login`'s browser grant;
#   - the choice between GitHub Pro and a public repository (see the README:
#     every gate depends on rulesets, which are Pro-only for private repos).
#
# UNVERIFIED, honestly: the ruleset is created through the REST API, which —
# unlike the UI dropdown — accepts a check context that has not reported yet.
# That claim held in documentation and has not yet been observed on a live
# repository; if a required check sits "expected" forever on your first pull
# request, run with --verify, which opens a throwaway pull request so every
# check reports once, then closes it.
#
# Options:
#   --app              also configure the GitHub App identity (APP_ID +
#                      APP_PRIVATE_KEY secrets); see the DECISIONS.md entry on
#                      why the App beats a PAT for unattended runs
#   --ssh-host <host>  after creating the repo, rewrite origin to this SSH host
#                      alias (e.g. github.com-yourname) — required when your
#                      key lives on a host alias, since the plain host has no
#                      key attached and every push fails
#   --public           create the repository public instead of private
#   --verify           open (and then close) a throwaway pull request so every
#                      PR-only check reports once and is registered in the UI
#   --skip-create      never create or push; only configure the existing repo

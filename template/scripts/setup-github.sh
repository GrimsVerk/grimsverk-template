# setup-github.sh — turn the README's manual GitHub setup into one run.
#
#     scripts/setup-github.sh [options]
#
# Plain shell on purpose, next to update-from-template.sh and for the same
# reason: setup is needed regardless of which agent or editor you use, so it
# does not live under .claude/ and depends on nothing vendor-specific.
#
# WHAT IT DOES, idempotently — every step reads before it writes, so re-running
# after a partial failure finishes the job instead of duplicating it:
#
#   1. creates the GitHub repository if this project has no origin, and pushes;
#   2. sets the merge settings (allow auto-merge, allow merge commits, delete
#      branches on merge);
#   3. sets the secrets that are missing, prompting for each value silently —
#      a value never appears in an argument list, a log, or an echo;
#   4. creates (or updates) the `grimsverk-gates` ruleset: active on the
#      default branch, deletions and force-pushes blocked, pull request
#      required with 0 approvals plus Code Owners review, and the required
#      status checks for this project's language. Deliberately NOT "require
#      linear history" — it blocks merge commits, which breaks the one-line
#      `git revert -m 1` rollback the whole auto-merge design leans on;
#   5. records its own transcript under docs/runs/setup/ — setup friction is
#      evidence, and the terminal scrollback was its only record until now.
#
# WHAT STAYS MANUAL, and each for a security reason rather than a missing
# feature:
#
#   - typing the secret VALUES. This script never fetches or stores a
#     credential; `claude setup-token` is an interactive OAuth flow. (There
#     are deliberately no PATs to mint any more — the App is the only GitHub
#     credential a project configures);
#   - creating the GitHub App (--app prints the exact URL and permission list;
#     the creation form itself is a click-through GitHub offers no API for);
#   - `gh auth login`'s browser grant;
#   - the choice between GitHub Pro and a public repository (see the README:
#     every gate depends on rulesets, which are Pro-only for private repos).
#
# UNVERIFIED, honestly: the ruleset is created through the REST API, which —
# unlike the UI dropdown — accepts a check context that has not reported yet.
# That claim held in documentation and has not yet been observed on a live
# repository; if a required check sits "expected" forever on your first pull
# request, run with --verify, which opens a throwaway pull request so every
# check reports once, then closes it.
#
# Options:
#   --app              also configure the GitHub App identity (APP_ID +
#                      APP_PRIVATE_KEY secrets); see the DECISIONS.md entry on
#                      why the App beats a PAT for unattended runs
#   --ssh-host <host>  after creating the repo, rewrite origin to this SSH host
#                      alias (e.g. github.com-yourname) — required when your
#                      key lives on a host alias, since the plain host has no
#                      key attached and every push fails
#   --public           create the repository public instead of private
#   --verify           open (and then close) a throwaway pull request so every
#                      PR-only check reports once and is registered in the UI
#   --skip-create      never create or push; only configure the existing repo
#   --gate-branch <b>  ALSO apply the gates ruleset to this branch (repeatable).
#                      For a delivery run whose base is not the default branch
#                      (deliver-loop.sh --base): without this the run's pull
#                      requests merge ungated, and unattended-ready.sh refuses
#                      the run. The default branch stays targeted either way.

# to `gh secret set` over stdin, touching no output stream).

# size cap at any size, so the transcript can always land — on main directly
# before the gates exist, on a docs/ branch after. A re-exec through `tee`
# rather than process substitution, because bash does not wait for a process
# substitution on exit and a transcript that races the assertions reading it
# is worse than none.

  GitHub App identity — the login the unattended driver opens pull requests
  as. Without it the driver opens them as YOU, and owner-authored.sh then
  compares your login to your login and passes, so docs/DESIGN.md and
  docs/VISION.md are unprotected overnight. See docs/DECISIONS.md.

  Create the App ONCE per account at

      https://github.com/settings/apps/new

    - GitHub App name .... anything unique
    - Homepage URL ....... this repository's URL is fine; nothing reads it
    - Webhook -> Active .. UNCHECK
    - Repository permissions:
        Contents ......... Read and write
        Pull requests .... Read and write
        Checks ........... Read-only   (a web-session driver reads CI results
                                        through the App; harmless everywhere else)
    - Where installed .... Only on this account

  Keep it at exactly those three permissions. The App is the identity the
  UNATTENDED driver acts as — never give it Administration or Secrets, or the
  driver could edit its own gates.

  Then, on the App's page: note the App ID (a number, NOT the Client ID),
  press "Generate a private key" (a .pem downloads), and press
  "Install App" -> install it on this repository AND on the template
  repository (template-sync reads the template through a token minted from
  this App — there is no PAT path). Then continue here.

# POSTing a duplicate name creates a second ruleset, and two rulesets' rules
# UNION, which is how a stale one quietly keeps an old check required forever.
#
# NOTE the update-in-place consequence for --gate-branch: the include list is
# REPLACED, not merged. Re-running with a different --gate-branch set installs
# exactly that set, and running with none returns the ruleset to the default
# branch only — which is also how a finished lane's protection is removed.

#
#     scripts/setup-github.sh [options]
#
# Plain shell on purpose, next to update-from-template.sh and for the same
# reason: setup is needed regardless of which agent or editor you use, so it
# does not live under .claude/ and depends on nothing vendor-specific.
#
# WHAT IT DOES, idempotently — every step reads before it writes, so re-running
# after a partial failure finishes the job instead of duplicating it:
#
#   1. creates the GitHub repository if this project has no origin, and pushes;
#   2. sets the merge settings (allow auto-merge, allow merge commits, delete
#      branches on merge);
#   3. sets the secrets that are missing, prompting for each value silently —
#      a value never appears in an argument list, a log, or an echo;
#   4. creates (or updates) the `grimsverk-gates` ruleset: active on the
#      default branch, deletions and force-pushes blocked, pull request
#      required with 0 approvals plus Code Owners review, and the required
#      status checks for this project's language. Deliberately NOT "require
#      linear history" — it blocks merge commits, which breaks the one-line
#      `git revert -m 1` rollback the whole auto-merge design leans on;
#   5. records its own transcript under docs/runs/setup/ — setup friction is
#      evidence, and the terminal scrollback was its only record until now.
#
# WHAT STAYS MANUAL, and each for a security reason rather than a missing
# feature:
#
#   - typing the secret VALUES. This script never fetches or stores a
#     credential; `claude setup-token` is an interactive OAuth flow. (There
#     are deliberately no PATs to mint any more — the App is the only GitHub
#     credential a project configures);
#   - creating the GitHub App (--app prints the exact URL and permission list;
#     the creation form itself is a click-through GitHub offers no API for);
#   - `gh auth login`'s browser grant;
#   - the choice between GitHub Pro and a public repository (see the README:
#     every gate depends on rulesets, which are Pro-only for private repos).
#
# UNVERIFIED, honestly: the ruleset is created through the REST API, which —
# unlike the UI dropdown — accepts a check context that has not reported yet.
# That claim held in documentation and has not yet been observed on a live
# repository; if a required check sits "expected" forever on your first pull
# request, run with --verify, which opens a throwaway pull request so every
# check reports once, then closes it.
#
# Options:
#   --app              also configure the GitHub App identity (APP_ID +
#                      APP_PRIVATE_KEY secrets); see the DECISIONS.md entry on
#                      why the App beats a PAT for unattended runs
#   --ssh-host <host>  after creating the repo, rewrite origin to this SSH host
#                      alias (e.g. github.com-yourname) — required when your
#                      key lives on a host alias, since the plain host has no
#                      key attached and every push fails
#   --public           create the repository public instead of private
#   --verify           open (and then close) a throwaway pull request so every
#                      PR-only check reports once and is registered in the UI
#   --skip-create      never create or push; only configure the existing repo
#   --gate-branch <b>  ALSO apply the gates ruleset to this branch (repeatable).
#                      For a delivery run whose base is not the default branch
#                      (deliver-loop.sh --base): without this the run's pull
#                      requests merge ungated, and unattended-ready.sh refuses
#                      the run. The default branch stays targeted either way.
#                      ADDITIVE (ESC-79): branches already gated stay gated.
#   --ungate <b>       remove this branch from the gates (repeatable). The only
#                      way to narrow the ruleset one branch at a time.
#   --gates-only       the --gate-branch set becomes the WHOLE list: every other
#                      branch currently gated loses its gates. Announced in a
#                      banner before it is applied.

  GitHub App identity — the login the unattended driver opens pull requests
  as. Without it the driver opens them as YOU, and owner-authored.sh then
  compares your login to your login and passes, so docs/DESIGN.md and
  docs/VISION.md are unprotected overnight. See docs/DECISIONS.md.

  Create the App ONCE per account at

      https://github.com/settings/apps/new

    - GitHub App name .... anything unique
    - Homepage URL ....... this repository's URL is fine; nothing reads it
    - Webhook -> Active .. UNCHECK
    - Repository permissions:
        Contents ......... Read and write
        Pull requests .... Read and write
        Checks ........... Read-only   (a web-session driver reads CI results
                                        through the App; harmless everywhere else)
    - Where installed .... Only on this account

  Keep it at exactly those three permissions. The App is the identity the
  UNATTENDED driver acts as — never give it Administration or Secrets, or the
  driver could edit its own gates.

  Then, on the App's page: note the App ID (a number, NOT the Client ID),
  press "Generate a private key" (a .pem downloads), and press
  "Install App" -> install it on this repository AND on the template
  repository (template-sync reads the template through a token minted from
  this App — there is no PAT path). Then continue here.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- 4. ruleset
# One ruleset, targeting the default branch by pointer (~DEFAULT_BRANCH) so it
# survives a rename — plus any --gate-branch, so a delivery run based on a
# non-default branch gets the same gates there. The REST API accepts contexts
# that have not reported yet (see the header's UNVERIFIED note).
# Update-in-place if it already exists:
# POSTing a duplicate name creates a second ruleset, and two rulesets' rules
# UNION, which is how a stale one quietly keeps an old check required forever.
#
# THE INCLUDE LIST IS ADDITIVE (ESC-79), and it was not always. A PUT sends the
# whole list, so building it from the flags alone means naming one branch
# REMOVES every branch not named. That is not theory: a lane told to "gate
# run/local alone" ran exactly that, stripped refs/heads/run/web from the shared
# ruleset while the OTHER lane was mid-run, and nine minutes later that lane
# merged a pull request 10 seconds after its required review check started and
# 2m31s before the check reported FAILURE. Unreviewed code the review gate had
# rejected landed on a protected branch, and nothing anywhere said the gate had
# gone. The runtime line even read "gated branches: the default branch, PLUS
# run/local" — the word "plus" describing a removal.
#
# So: read what is gated now, union the --gate-branch set into it, and take a
# branch OUT only when asked explicitly (--ungate, --gates-only). A removal is
# announced in a banner before it is applied, because losing a gate is the one
# change here that can end with unreviewed code on a protected branch.

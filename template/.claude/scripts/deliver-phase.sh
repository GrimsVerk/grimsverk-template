# halves of the system identified the same object by different names and
# nothing reconciled them. A plan filed as `sync.md` with `slug:
# milestone-4-sync-transport` was matched against an earlier merged
# `feat/sync-index-1` by prefix, marked built, and never orchestrated. No pull
# request was ever opened for it, so no gate ever got the chance to notice:
# coverage.sh reported its requirements covered, the loop walked to ACCEPTANCE,
# and the run exited 0 with the work simply absent.

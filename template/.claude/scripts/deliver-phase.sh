# The phase logic for unattended delivery lives HERE, once, and both drivers
# consume it: `deliver-loop.sh` on a local machine, and the `/deliver-loop`
# command in a Claude Code web session. One detector is what keeps the two
# modes from drifting — a phase bug is fixed in one place and both inherit it.

# READ-ONLY by contract. This script mutates nothing: no commits, no pushes,
# no sessions. It recomputes the project's state from the tree and the open
# pull requests every time it runs, because recomputed state cannot go stale
# and cannot be corrupted by a killed run — the driver persists almost nothing
# and trusts none of what it does persist.

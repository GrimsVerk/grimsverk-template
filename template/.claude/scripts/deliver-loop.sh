# deliver-loop.sh — the local delivery driver: run the pipeline until the
# design is built, with nobody watching.
#
#     .claude/scripts/deliver-loop.sh [options]
#
# This is a SCHEDULER, NOT AN AGENT — deterministic bash the owner starts, in
# the position orchestration.md already blesses ("you know what is running,
# because you started both"). It holds no model and makes no judgment beyond
# branching on exit codes: each iteration it asks `deliver-phase.sh` what the
# world needs next, dispatches ONE headless session (or waits on one open pull
# request), and comes back. All waiting is mechanical — `gh pr checks --watch`
# — so no model budget is spent watching CI (docs/DECISIONS.md, the waiting
# ruling). The one-layer rule survives intact: this driver opens sessions;
# only an orchestrator session spawns workers.
#
# The web-session variant of this driver is `/deliver-loop`
# (.claude/commands/deliver-loop.md); both consume the same phase detector,
# which is what keeps the two modes from drifting. Choose a mode by choosing
# which entry point you start.
#
# STATE IS RECOMPUTED, NOT TRUSTED. Every iteration re-reads the tree and the
# open pull requests. The only persistence is `.claude/deliver-loop/`
# (gitignored): failure signatures, evidence ids the oracle dismissed, the
# design/vision SHAs at run start, and the run log as it is being written
# (`run.md`).
#
# THE RUN LEAVES EVIDENCE BEHIND, AND THAT IS NEW. The run log used to end its
# life gitignored — and in web mode, inside a container that is reclaimed — so
# the loop the owner described (run, learn, fix the template, run again) had
# nothing to learn from. At EVERY stop, whatever the reason, the driver copies
# the run report to `docs/runs/<timestamp>/run.md`, collects the review gate's
# payloads and replies beside it, and opens one pull request carrying both.
#
# It is written to the gitignored path DURING the run and copied at the stop,
# rather than written straight into docs/runs/. An untracked file sitting in the
# tree while an orchestrator session runs `git add -A` is a file that ends up
# inside somebody's feature commit, and the report would then be spread across
# the branches it was reporting on.
#
# STOPS, and their exit codes — every stop says why, none degrades silently:
#   0  done: the acceptance pass ran (or was already recorded);
#      docs/runs/<timestamp>/run.md has the report and the pending-on-owner list
#   2  setup: refused before dispatching anything — readiness check failed,
#      no design ids, dirty tree, wrong branch
#   3  the same failure signature three times — a pattern, not a blip
#      (deliver.md step 5's rule, mechanised)
#   4  blocked on the owner: a green pull request only the owner can merge
#      (gate paths are CODEOWNERS-owned), reported rather than waited out
#   5  iteration limit, or the livelock guard
#   6  allowance spent: the weekly percentage-point allowance, or a limit the
#      owner set (--max-prs, --max-hours)
#
# THE CEILING IS ASKED FOR, EVERY RUN. Nothing below has a default, because a
# limit the owner did not choose is a limit they will not recognise when it
# fires at 3am — and the numbers that used to be here (25 points, 10 pull
# requests, 8 hours) were picked by the session that wrote the script. The rate
# limit is the only stop that applies by default; the rest exist for a run
# deliberately cut short ("give it twenty minutes; longer means something is
# wrong"). With no limit at all the run refuses to start.
#
# Which question gets asked is decided by PROBING the usage gauge, not by
# guessing the environment: a reading means a terminal, no reading means a web
# session, and that is a fact rather than an inference.
#
# Options (all unset by default):
#   --base <branch>        the base branch this run merges into (default: the
#                          repository's default branch). SAID OUT LOUD at run
#                          start, so with several drivers running you always
#                          know which branch belongs to which. The checkout
#                          must BE on this branch. Every pull-request query is
#                          scoped to it (one pipeline PR in flight PER BASE —
#                          two runs on two bases never wait on or fix each
#                          other's pull requests), every worker branches off
#                          it, and every pull request is opened --base onto it.
#                          On a non-default base, every branch this run pushes
#                          gets a `--<base>` suffix so twin runs building the
#                          same slugs cannot collide on branch names. The base
#                          branch must be covered by the gates ruleset —
#                          unattended-ready.sh refuses when it is not; add it
#                          with scripts/setup-github.sh --gate-branch <branch>.
#   --land-evidence        land a PREVIOUS run's leftover report buffer and its
#                          collected evidence NOW, dispatching nothing, then
#                          exit. For a run killed too hard for its EXIT landing
#                          to fire (SIGKILL, a crashed machine, a pulled plug):
#                          its report survives in the gitignored buffer, where
#                          normally the NEXT run sets it aside and lands it —
#                          but a one-shot run, a finished test lane, or a
#                          machine being retired has no next run, and evidence
#                          waiting on one is evidence dying by default. Pass
#                          the same --base the dead run used, so the evidence
#                          lands in that run's own lane. Skips the readiness,
#                          identity, worktree and budget preflights on purpose:
#                          a recovery that refuses because the repository is no
#                          longer fit to RUN would be refusing to record that
#                          very fact. Degrades without an App identity — the
#                          branch still pushes; only the pull request is
#                          skipped, and it says so.
#   --budget-points <n>    percentage points of the WEEKLY limit this run may
#                          spend. The window is weekly on the owner's ruling,
#                          and because the 5-hour window resets mid-run and
#                          makes the delta go negative. Both weekly limits are
#                          watched — the all-models one and the per-model one,
#                          which has its own smaller cap and can bind first.
#   --max-prs <n>          stop after this many pull requests

#   --max-iterations <n>   stop after this many iterations

# The orchestrator session's reach. Explicit and on the command line: the
# whitelist below is everything /orchestrate documents itself doing — spawn
# workers, assemble branches, open one pull request — and nothing else, so
# `git reset --hard`, `--no-verify` and `gh pr merge` are unreachable rather
# than forbidden.
#
# ON THE BARE `Write,Edit`. It is not an oversight and it is not a blank
# cheque. Assembly genuinely writes across the tree — resolving a conflict
# between two workers' branches, correcting docs/architecture.md — and any list
# narrow enough to be a real fence would either be wrong for some project's
# layout or would have to enumerate the plan's own Files: entries, which the
# pipeline writes. So the two documents that must never be reached this way are
# denied instead of un-allowed, in three places, because an allowlist cannot
# express "everything except":
#
#   1. .claude/settings.json denies Write/Edit on docs/DESIGN.md and
#      docs/VISION.md for every session in the project. Deny beats allow, and
#      that file is CODEOWNERS-owned so a session cannot widen it.
#   2. `Bash(claude:*)` is absent here, and settings.json no longer allows
#      `claude -p` either, so this session cannot start another session to do
#      the writing on its behalf. Its one door to a new agent is
#      spawn-worker.sh, which refuses --role architect.
#   3. .github/scripts/owner-authored.sh fails any pull request touching those
#      documents that the owner did not OPEN — and since this driver now opens
#      pull requests as the GitHub App rather than as the owner, that check
#      finally binds. It is the layer that actually stops the merge; the two
#      above just make the wrong thing hard to do by accident.
#
# AND `gh pr create` IS ABSENT, WHICH IS THE POINT OF THIS LIST'S NEWEST EDIT.
# ESC-26 gave the driver an App identity so no unattended pull request is
# authored by the owner, and fixed the two places the DRIVER opens one. This
# grant was the two places a SESSION opened one: run_session() passes no
# credential, so an orchestrate or acceptance session inherited the owner's
# local `gh` auth and every feature and acceptance pull request in an unattended
# run was authored by them.
#
# That is worse than a provenance problem. docs/acceptance.md is
# CODEOWNERS-owned and GitHub does not let an author approve their own pull
# request — so the one artifact whose review is the entire point of the run
# could not be approved by the only person entitled to approve it.
#
# The button moved rather than the token: an installation token lasts an hour
# and SESSION_TIMEOUT is an hour, so handing one to a session would fail late,
# rarely, and looking like a GitHub outage. The driver opens both pull requests
# after the session returns, exactly as it already does for every worker.

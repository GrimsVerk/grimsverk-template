description: Drive unattended delivery from a Claude Code web session, event-driven
---

You are the **delivery driver's web-session frontend**. The other frontend is
`.claude/scripts/deliver-loop.sh`, run in a terminal; the owner chooses a mode
by choosing which one to start. Both consume the same phase detector —
`.claude/scripts/deliver-phase.sh` — which is what keeps the modes from
drifting. You add nothing to its judgment: you dispatch what it says and you
wait the way a web session waits.

**How a web session waits — and how it must not.** The local driver blocks on
`gh pr checks --watch`, which is free there. In a hosted session, holding a
turn open to watch CI burns the session's lifetime on information that has not
changed. So waiting here is **event-driven**: after confirming a pull request
is open, subscribe to that PR's activity, schedule a fallback check-in about
an hour out (events are best-effort, not guaranteed), and **end the turn**.
The wake — an event or the check-in — re-enters this loop: run the detector
again, act on what it says now. Never poll in a loop inside a turn; never
sleep to wait for CI.

## Each turn (first, and on every wake)

**Before anything else, every turn: establish gh's credential — and know
which identity it is.** Try the App first:
`export GH_TOKEN="$(.claude/scripts/app-token.sh)"` — installation tokens
last one hour, a turn is shorter, and a token carried across turns fails late
looking like a GitHub outage. If the mint fails but `gh auth status`
succeeds anyway, you are on a hosted platform whose egress proxy replaces
every Authorization header with the OWNER's credential and blocks the /app
endpoints outright (ESC-50): minting is impossible there by design, with a
perfectly good key. On such a platform the ambient login is your identity
for reads, pushes, and workflow dispatches — but never for opening pull
requests (next paragraph). If neither the mint nor the ambient login works,
report the exact error and stop; do not improvise a credential.

**Opening pull requests — always as the App, whichever identity you hold.**
Every pipeline pull request must be authored by the App, never the owner:
`owner-authored.sh`'s protection of the steering documents and the
acceptance pull request's approvability both stand on it. Two ways, chosen
by your credential:

- your `GH_TOKEN` is a minted App token → `gh pr create` directly;
- ambient login (hosted platform, mint impossible) → push the branch, then
  dispatch the server-side opener, which mints the App token where minting
  works and opens the pull request as the App:
  `gh workflow run open-pr.yml -f head=<branch> -f base=<this run's base>
  -f title=<title> -f body=<body>`. The dispatch returns before the pull
  request exists: give it up to two minutes, checking with
  `gh api "repos/<owner/repo>/pulls?state=open&base=<base>" --jq
  '.[] | select(.head.ref=="<branch>") | .number'`; if nothing appears, read
  that workflow run's log, report it, and stop. Never open the pull request
  under the ambient login as a fallback — an owner-authored pipeline pull
  request is the one artifact this pipeline must never produce.

**REST only, on the hosted platform (ESC-51).** The same proxy that owns the
credential refuses GraphQL except a pinned set of review operations — and
`gh pr ...`, `gh repo ...` are GraphQL. The detector and the readiness check
already speak REST; when you need an API answer yourself, use
`gh api repos/<owner/repo>/...`, never a `gh pr`/`gh repo` porcelain
command. A GraphQL refusal blames the credential in its error text; do not
believe it — the credential is fine, the query shape is the problem.

1. **Establish the base branch, first turn only, out loud.** The owner may
   name one in the scope arguments (`base: <branch>`); otherwise it is the
   default branch. Say it before anything else, in these words: "THIS RUN'S
   BASE BRANCH: `<branch>` — every pull request this run opens merges into it,
   and this run waits only on pull requests targeting it." With several
   drivers running, this line is how the owner knows which branch belongs to
   which. Record it in your working notes; it never changes mid-run. Scoping
   rules, all three mechanical:
   - run the detector as `RUN_BASE=<branch> .claude/scripts/deliver-phase.sh`,
     and the readiness check as `RUN_BASE=<branch>
     .github/scripts/unattended-ready.sh --runtime` — `--runtime` because this
     session's identity — the App, or the ambient login where minting is
     impossible (ESC-50) — cannot read repository administration; the flag
     checks what this identity honestly can (a working credential, the
     effective rules on the base branch, the documents), and the full check
     remains the owner's, at setup. It still refuses when the gates
     do not bind the base branch (fix:
     `scripts/setup-github.sh --gate-branch <branch>`);
   - open every pull request with an explicit `--base <branch>`;
   - on a non-default base, suffix every branch you push with
     `--<branch, non-alphanumerics as ->` (e.g. base `run/web` →
     `feat/<slug>--run-web`), exactly as the local driver does, so twin runs
     building the same slugs cannot collide on branch names.
2. **Preflight, first turn only:** `gh auth status` (on the credential
   established above);
   `.github/scripts/unattended-ready.sh --runtime` (with `RUN_BASE`, above) —
   a refusal ends the run, report it verbatim; `coverage.sh` rc 2 likewise (the design
   is the owner's to land, `/design` cannot be run for them). Note the
   run-start SHAs of `docs/DESIGN.md` and `docs/VISION.md`, the start time,
   and a PR counter in your working notes.
3. **Sync and steer-check:** pull the base branch. If either steering
   document's SHA changed since run start, say so, reset your failure memory,
   and re-derive — that is the owner steering, not an error.
4. **Budget:** **ask the owner for a limit before you start, every run, and do
   not invent one.** In this mode `budget-probe.sh` will not find a usage
   gauge — a web session has no local CLI and no reach to the usage endpoint —
   so the percentage ceiling cannot apply here, and the limit has to be
   something countable in this session. Ask, in these words:

   > No usage gauge is reachable in a web session, so I cannot stop on your
   > subscription percentage. Give me at least one limit I *can* count — max
   > pull requests, max wall-clock hours, or max iterations — with exact
   > numbers. Any combination; blank means no limit of that kind.

   If the owner gives none, **do not start**: say that nothing would stop the
   run and wait. Record the numbers in your working notes at run start, count
   against them every iteration, and stop and report when one is reached.
   Stopping is the behaviour; degrading quietly is not.

   A limit reached is not a failure and must not read like one — say which
   limit, what was done, and what remains. Separately, note anything that
   looked *anomalous* rather than expensive (twenty commits for a simple
   slice, say). That is a signal for the owner, never a reason to stop.
5. **Detect:** run `RUN_BASE=<base> .claude/scripts/deliver-phase.sh` and act
   on its PHASE (it reports the base back as a `BASE=` line — a mismatch with
   your noted base means you exported the wrong thing; stop and fix that
   first):
   - **WAIT** — the pull request it names targets this run's base; one
     targeting another base never appears here and is never yours to touch.
     Subscribe to the PR's activity, schedule the ~1h fallback
     check-in, end the turn. On waking to a red check: compute the failure
     signature (head ref + sorted failing check names); the same signature a
     third time ends the run as a pattern (exit posture 3 below); otherwise
     fix on the existing branch and push — never a second pull request. On
     waking to a merge: continue to step 5 again. Green but unmerged after a
     grace period means an owner-owned path: report and end the run unless
     told to keep polling.
   - **ORACLE / STEWARD / PLAN** — dispatch one worker via
     `.claude/scripts/spawn-worker.sh --role <role> --engine claude --base
     <this run's base>` with the matching command file as its prompt plus the
     UNATTENDED addendum and the detector's scope; then push the worker
     branch under a `docs/`-prefixed name (with the lane suffix on a
     non-default base) via `git push origin worker/<id>:docs/<ref>` — the
     worker branch is neither docs-exempt nor slug-resolvable — and open the
     pull request as the App (the rule above). Then you are in WAIT.
   - **ORCHESTRATE** — run `/orchestrate <slug>` in this session, telling it
     `UNATTENDED RUN`, the run's base branch, and the exact feature-branch
     name (`feat/<slug>`, plus the lane suffix on a non-default base) so it
     branches off the base, pushes that branch, and stops. **You** then open
     the pull request as the App (the rule above), the same way you do for a
     worker branch — never under the owner's own credentials, or
     `.github/scripts/owner-authored.sh` compares the owner's login to the
     owner's login and passes for every pull request this run ever opened. Then
     you are in WAIT.
   - **ACCEPTANCE** — run `/deliver` step 6 only, marked `UNATTENDED RUN`, so
     it commits `docs/acceptance.md` on a `docs/` branch and pushes without
     opening anything. **You** open that pull request as the App. This one is
     not interchangeable with the others: `docs/acceptance.md` is
     `CODEOWNERS`-owned and GitHub does not let an author approve their own
     pull request, so opening it as the owner produces the one pull request in
     the run that they cannot approve. When the detector says
     ACCEPTANCE again with nothing open, write the final report and end the
     run: requirements covered, criteria passed/failed/pending-on-owner with
     evidence, escapes logged, and the pending list as the honest bottom
     line.
   - **SETUP** — report the reason and end the run.

## Container realities

- **Worker fan-out is capped lower here:** hosted containers have fewer cores
  and less disk than a desktop — set `SPAWN_MAX_WORKERS=4` unless the owner
  says otherwise (orchestration.md's 12 is a desktop number).
- **The engine is `claude`.** No codex CLI is present in hosted containers.
- **Nothing local survives.** The container is reclaimed between wakes with
  the session's context intact but the disk not guaranteed — which costs
  nothing, because the pipeline already pushes every artifact: plans, ledger
  appends, handoffs, and code all live on branches and pull requests. Keep
  run bookkeeping (start SHAs, PR count, failure signatures) in your session
  notes, not in files.

## The run leaves evidence behind, and that is your job here

This mode is exactly where a gitignored run log dies: the container is
reclaimed, so a report that lives only on disk is a report nobody reads. The
local driver lands one automatically at every stop; **here, you are the driver,
so you land it.**

At the run's stop, whatever the reason — done, blocked on the owner, a limit
reached, a pattern of failures, a setup refusal:

1. Write your run report to `docs/runs/<timestamp>/run.md`, using the same
   timestamp you fixed at run start. It carries what each iteration did, every
   dispatch and its outcome, which stop ended the run and why, and anything that
   looked anomalous.
2. Run `.claude/scripts/collect-evidence.sh --run-dir docs/runs/<timestamp>
   --since <run start, RFC3339>`. It gathers the review gate's payloads and
   replies — what the reviewer was shown and what it said — beside the report.
   The review gate is the only load-bearing gate with no fixtures, and it was
   also the only one leaving no trace to build fixtures from.
3. Commit both on a `docs/run-<timestamp>` branch and open the pull request —
   as the App, per the credential rule above.

**Do this even when the run failed.** A run that ended badly is the one whose
evidence is worth most, and it is the one a stop-and-report instinct skips.

## What never changes between the two frontends

One pipeline pull request in flight per base branch — runs on separate base
branches never wait on or touch each other's pull requests, and two pull
requests into ONE base is still illegal; the design layer rules (AGENTS.md,
"Mid-run authority"); every stop says why it stopped; the exit condition on a
pull request is **no check still pending**, never "the PR is no longer open" —
red never closes a pull request, so that condition reads failure as success.

Scope, if the owner named one (otherwise: the whole design):

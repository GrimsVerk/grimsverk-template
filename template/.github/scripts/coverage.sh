# coverage.sh — is every requirement in the design actually planned?
#
# Reads the requirement ids (R1, R2, ...) from docs/DESIGN.md and the `covers:`
# field from every plan under docs/plans/, and reports which requirements no plan
# claims. Also reports the reverse: plans covering ids the design doesn't define,
# which usually means a requirement was renumbered or a typo crept in.
#
# This answers the question "all the slices merged, so are we done?" — which the
# backlog cannot answer. An empty backlog is a statement about the backlog. A
# requirement no plan covers is work nobody scheduled, and it stays invisible
# right up until someone goes looking for the feature.
#
# NOT a CI gate and deliberately not wired into one: mid-project, uncovered
# requirements are the normal state. It exits non-zero when gaps exist so the
# project loop can branch on it, not so a pull request can fail on it.
#
# Usage:  coverage.sh
#
# Exit: 0 = every requirement is covered · 1 = gaps (expected mid-project)

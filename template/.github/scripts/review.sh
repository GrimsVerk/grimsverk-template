# review.sh — the headless PR review gate (soft gate).
#
# Runs a read-only review agent over the PR diff and exits non-zero on any
# blocking finding, so a red review blocks merge exactly like a failing test.
# This is a SOFT gate layered on top of CI (the HARD gate) — it never replaces
# CI. Engine-configurable so the gate is not locked to one vendor.
#
# The review agent gets fresh context (a one-shot headless run, not the author's
# session) and only the diff as text — it has no ability to edit the code or the
# PR. That context isolation is the real independence; running a DIFFERENT model
# than the workers is a nice-to-have (set REVIEW_MODEL), not required.
#
# Required env:
#   BASE_SHA, HEAD_SHA   commits bounding the PR diff (base...head)
#   HEAD_REF             the PR head branch, used to resolve which plan applies
# Optional env:
#   REVIEW_ENGINE        claude (default) | codex
#   REVIEW_MODEL         model id for the engine (default: the engine's default)
#
# Fails CLOSED: any engine error, or a missing / BLOCK verdict, exits non-zero.

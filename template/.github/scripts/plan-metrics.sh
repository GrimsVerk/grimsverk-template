# plan-metrics.sh — compute mechanical facts about a PR diff, for the reviewer.
#
# This script COMPUTES, it does not JUDGE. It emits numbers; the reviewer decides
# whether a deviation is justified. It ALWAYS exits 0 — an overrun is a question,
# never a build failure. (A missing plan IS a failure, but that is
# plan-resolve.sh's job, not this one.)
#
# Facts emitted:
#   - actual added lines per slice vs the slice's estimate, flagged past a
#     threshold
#   - new files added
#   - new dependencies added
#   - test-to-implementation added-line ratio
#
# Usage:  plan-metrics.sh [path/to/plan.md]
#   With no argument it reports the plan-independent facts only (used for
#   branches exempt from planning).
#
# Required env:
#   BASE_SHA, HEAD_SHA   commits bounding the PR diff (base...head)

# A slice is flagged when actual > estimate * FACTOR, but never below FLOOR —
# without the floor a 4-line slice that lands at 13 would "overrun by 3x" and
# train the reviewer to ignore the signal.

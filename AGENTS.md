# grimsverk-template — agent guidelines

Canonical working instructions for any coding agent in this repository.
Tool-specific entry points (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`) only point here; rules are
never duplicated elsewhere.

## Workflow

**Branches.** Never commit to the default branch directly; work on a branch and
open a pull request. **The pipeline merges, not you and not the owner** — a PR
lands when its required checks go green (see "The merge pipeline" below), so
your job ends at opening it. Never force-push or rewrite history on a branch
that has been pushed. **Any branch you open a pull request from must contain its
plan's `slug`** — CI resolves the plan by matching slugs against the branch name,
and a PR whose plan can't be resolved fails the `plan` check. Name intermediate
branches with the slug too, so they stay traceable to the work they belong to.

**Planning.** Non-trivial work gets a plan before it gets code — copy
`docs/plans/_TEMPLATE.md` to `docs/plans/<slug>.md` and fill it in. A plan is
3-5 **vertical** slices: each delivers something observable end-to-end, never a
horizontal layer (all the storage, then all the CLI), because horizontal work
leaves nothing testable until the end, when steering is most expensive. Each
slice declares the files it touches, its type and method signatures, and a line
estimate. Before writing any slices, list the decisions you had to guess at
rather than derive, and classify each by one contract test: **HIGH-risk** if
the candidate answers change slice boundaries, a Signatures block, an external
format or schema, or anything expensive to reverse — unsure means HIGH. Then
who rules depends on who is awake. Attended, the owner rules on everything
before slices are written, and the rulings are recorded in the plan.
Unattended, the oracle rules: a HIGH uncertainty is filed as a `BL-<n>` under
"Uncertainties awaiting oracle ruling" in `docs/BACKLOG.md` with the proposed
default, and planning stops until a decision cites it; a LOW one proceeds on
the recorded default and the oracle reviews it next cycle. Never silently —
every guess is filed either way (`docs/DECISIONS.md`, the mid-run authority
ruling).

**The stop is conditional on there being something to stop for.** If every
decision was derived from the design — `docs/DESIGN.md` and
`docs/DESIGN.oracle.md`, which are read together — rather than guessed, write
"no uncertainties — every decision derived from the design" in that section and
keep going. A gate that fires when it has nothing to report trains people to click
through it, which is how it stops working on the day it matters. The plan is
still reviewed by the owner before it merges, so a falsely empty list is visible
where it counts. The estimate is a **tripwire, not a target**: never compress code,
drop error handling, or thin tests to come in under it. An overrun does not fail
the build; CI reports the delta and the reviewer asks whether it was justified.

**Mid-run authority.** Plans derive only from the design layer — `docs/DESIGN.md`
and `docs/DESIGN.oracle.md`. When new work surfaces mid-run, it enters through
the chain and never sideways: the oracle amends `docs/DESIGN.oracle.md` on its
own pull request, a plan follows on its own pull request, then code. No agent
plans work the design layer does not name, and no agent widens a plan to
smuggle work past that rule — `.github/scripts/oracle-decisions.sh` enforces it
mechanically on the unattended path. The owner steers an unattended run by
editing `docs/VISION.md` and `docs/DESIGN.md` (which remain owner-landed), and
reviews the built system at the end; nothing mid-run waits on them. **One
pipeline pull request in flight at a time**: nothing is dispatched while one is
open, which keeps every merge tested against the tree it will actually land on
and keeps the review gate's budget for the pull request that needs it.

**`docs/VISION.md` must be finished before a plan lands, and not before that.**
The vision does not have to be written before the design — writing it after is
often the better order, because by then the owner knows what the thing is, where
a vision written first is a guess about their own priorities. What must not
happen is implementation starting while it is empty, and implementation starts
at the plan. This is checked, not asked for: a pull request that adds or edits a
plan fails while any `##` section of `docs/VISION.md` is still empty
(`.github/scripts/vision-complete.sh`). Design-doc pull requests pass freely,
which is what makes deferring the vision safe rather than merely tolerated. A
section the project does not want is DELETED rather than left blank — an absent
section reads as a decision, an empty one as an omission — and deleting the
whole file is how a project opts out of the oracle.

**A plan opens with a decision-complete summary.** One document, not two: a
short plan the owner approves and a long one an agent builds from will drift,
and then the approval covered something that was not built. So the plan starts
with a `## Summary` the owner can approve from alone.

- **Decision-complete** — every choice the owner could say no to appears there.
  Nothing they would refuse may live only in the body.
- **One screen**, ~40 lines, a hard ceiling. Not fitting is itself a signal that
  the plan is doing too much.
- **It carries** what is being built and the requirement or evidence it serves;
  each decision expensive to reverse; each thing deliberately *not* done; and
  anything that costs the owner something — a gate change, a new required check,
  money, a manual step.
- **It leaves out** file lists, signatures, test matrices, sequencing, and prose
  defending choices nobody would contest. Those belong in the body, which is
  written for the agent that builds it and may be as long as that needs.
- **It ends with the open questions** — an explicit "what I need you to rule on"
  list. Scattered through the body, those are the reason reading a plan end to
  end is the only safe way to approve one.
- **Promotion rule.** The body may elaborate a summary decision; it may never
  introduce one. If a detail turns out to be a decision, move it up.

**A plan lands before the code it plans.** Commit it on its own `docs/` branch,
let it merge, and only then branch off the default branch to build it. This is
enforced, not advisory: the `plan` check fails a pull request whose plan does not
already exist at its base commit. A plan written alongside its implementation
specifies nothing — the estimates, the file list, and the slice boundaries all
end up as whatever the change turned out to need, and the reviewer is left
checking a diff against a document from that same diff. `CODEOWNERS` puts
`docs/plans/` behind the owner's review, so merging the plan is the ruling on it.

**Template updates are the third kind of change.** Pulling template improvements
in with `copier update` is neither planned work nor a trivial chore: it was
specified and reviewed in the *template* repository, at the merge that produced
the version being pulled in, so no plan here could ever describe it. Put it on a
`template/` branch, which the `plan` check exempts and the **`test-the-tests`**
check ignores. What earns that exemption is `template-sync`, which replays
`copier update` from the base commit and fails unless the result is byte-for-byte
this pull request — a stronger guarantee than a plan, because it proves nothing
hand-written rode along. A `template/` branch may therefore carry the template's
output and **nothing else**; a hand change on top belongs in its own later pull
request, with a plan.

A genuinely trivial change — a typo, a doc tweak — may skip planning by using a
`chore/` or `docs/` branch prefix, which the `plan` check exempts. That escape
hatch exists so small fixes aren't ceremony; reaching for it to avoid planning
real work is a rule violation, and it is visible in the branch name precisely so
that it can't be done quietly. It is also **size-capped** — an exempt branch
adding more than ~50 lines fails the `plan` check — and the reviewer is told to
scrutinise exempt branches harder rather than to relax, because an unplanned
change is less checked than a planned one, not more trusted.

**The documents this process itself demands are exempt from that cap**, and
only they: a branch whose entire diff sits inside `docs/plans/`,
`docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/DESIGN.oracle.md`, `docs/oracle/`, `docs/VISION.md`,
`docs/acceptance.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/runs/` or `docs/BACKLOG.md`
passes at any size. This list is exactly the one
`.github/scripts/plan-resolve.sh` enforces — the prose and the script must name
the same paths, because the review gate judges by this text while the `plan`
check judges by that script, and a path present in one and absent from the
other is a branch one gate passes and the other blocks. Each entry earned its
place the same way: a document the process requires, necessarily long, that no
plan can ever cover — a completed design doc runs to hundreds of lines, the
plan template is over a hundred before anything is filled in, a real run's
evidence under `docs/runs/` always exceeds a cap meant for typo fixes, and the
`BL-<n>` filings the Planning rule requires must be able to travel with the
plan that raised them. Writing a plan is not skipping planning; it is the
planning, and `CODEOWNERS` still puts the owned paths behind the owner's
review, while `docs/DESIGN.oracle.md` and `docs/BACKLOG.md` are constrained by
their own append-only checks instead. Touch one file outside those paths and
the cap is back: split the branch rather than widening the exemption.

**Commits.** One conceptually contained commit per unit of work, pushed
when complete, with an imperative one-line message. The test suite must
pass before every commit. Documentation is updated in the same commit as
the code it describes — docs never lag the code.

**Tests.** New behaviour comes with tests in the same commit. The suite
runs offline and deterministically; a test that needs an unavailable
optional resource skips with a clear reason rather than failing.

**Who writes the tests.** A slice's code and its tests are written by
**different agents, in parallel, neither able to see the other's work**. The
test author works from the slice's declared behaviour and signatures — never
from the implementation, which is why it is written at the same time rather than
afterwards. An agent that writes both describes what its code happens to do,
bugs included, and calls that a test suite. The separation is structural, not a
promise to be careful: each agent works in its own worktree off the same base,
so the other's output is not there to read. The two meet at assembly, and tests
disagreeing with the code is the signal that something needs a human decision —
not a nuisance to smooth over by editing whichever side is easier.

This is checked, not just asked for. Tests written blind are committed with a
`Blind-Tests: <slug>-<n>` trailer, before the implementation is merged, and
`.github/scripts/blind-tests.sh` reports to the reviewer any of those test files
that a later commit in the same pull request modified. Editing a test after it
was written blind is allowed — it may have asserted something the slice never
promised — but it is visible, and the commit that does it must say why. Weakening
a test so the existing implementation passes is a blocking finding.

**Architecture doc.** At the end of every slice, update `docs/architecture.md`
so it describes what now exists and how it flows. Keep it at the level of
**logic, not code**: what the components are, what data moves between them, what
happens on the main paths. It is not overhead paid for someone else's benefit —
it is the file a future agent reads to get its bearings from the repository
alone, and a human reading the same file is what keeps it honest. A slice isn't
finished until it's accurate.

**The design is two documents.** `docs/DESIGN.md` is the owner's and is
`CODEOWNERS`-owned: changing it waits for them. `docs/DESIGN.oracle.md` is the
evidence-driven ledger an agent may append to unattended, and is deliberately
**not** owned — ownership there would stop overnight work, which is the point of
having it. Read them together; a requirement is a requirement whichever document
declares it, and `coverage.sh` unions both.

What keeps the second one safe is mechanical, not a promise
(`.github/scripts/oracle-decisions.sh`): every decision cites evidence that
already landed — an `ESC-<n>` or a `BL-<n>` — so a design change can only ever
*metabolise something logged*, never be invented; decisions are append-only and
superseded rather than revised; ids start at **R1000** because requirement ids
share one integer space; and each decision names the `docs/VISION.md` statement
it relied on, so the owner steers by editing that statement rather than by
arguing with each decision.

**`docs/DESIGN.md` and `docs/VISION.md` are WRITTEN by agents and LANDED by the
owner.** You may write them, commit them, and push the branch — that is most of
the work, and `/design` does exactly that. You may not open the pull request:
`.github/scripts/owner-authored.sh` fails any pull request touching either file
that the owner did not open, and it is a required check. Push the branch, say
its name in your report, and stop.

The reason is short. **If any agent can land the design, `docs/DESIGN.oracle.md`
has no reason to exist** — an agent that can edit the design does not need an
evidence ledger. That ledger is how the design gets corrected from real evidence
overnight, and it only means something while the design itself is out of reach.
`CODEOWNERS` would give you the owner's approval on a diff they did not compose;
this gives their authorship, which means they have read it.

Nothing else moves: plans, `docs/DESIGN.oracle.md` and the handoffs are all
still written AND opened by agents. This guards project setup, not ongoing work
— once both documents exist, the orchestrator runs to completion without it
firing again.

Writing there is the **oracle's** job and nobody else's. If you are not the
oracle and you believe the design is wrong, that belongs in `docs/BACKLOG.md`
where every other objection goes.

**Dependencies.** No new dependencies without the owner's approval — ask first,
and **land the approval as a repository artifact before the dependency merges**:
a `docs/DECISIONS.md` entry, or a `docs/BACKLOG.md` item the pull request cites.
Record what it is for, why the standard library or an existing dependency will
not do, and its licence.

This rule used to end "ask first, in chat", which contradicted "Chat is not
storage" a few sections below — at exactly the point where a future session
most needs the record. `plan-metrics.sh` already detects an added dependency
mechanically, so the reviewer can check that a detected addition has an entry
behind it, and six months from now the answer to "why is this here?" is in the
repository instead of in a conversation nobody can open.

A lockfile that moves on its own is not covered by that detection —
`plan-metrics.sh` reads the manifests, not the lock. Say so in the pull request
when you refresh one.

**Licensing.** This project is intentionally unlicensed: there is no
`LICENSE` file and no `license` field in package metadata, and their absence
is a decision, not an omission. Licensing is assessed per project by the
owner, at the point it actually matters — publication, distribution, or
accepting outside contributions — because a default chosen up front silently
attaches terms to a project that never revisits them. So: do not add a
license file, do not populate a `license` field, and do not ask which license
to use. If a task genuinely cannot proceed without one, say so in chat and
let the owner decide.

**Decisions.** Design choices and owner rulings are recorded in
`docs/DECISIONS.md` (ADR-lite: one dated entry per decision, newest at the
bottom; the file ships with the template's own rulings already recorded, and
project decisions append below them). A recorded ruling is never
silently reversed — to change one, argue the case in chat, wait for the
owner, then add a superseding entry. History is never rewritten.

**Work queue.** When working unattended, implement only items the owner
has approved in `docs/BACKLOG.md` ("Approved" section, top to bottom), and
keep going until the list is done or you are truly blocked. New ideas are
written into "Proposed" as text — never coded unprompted. If an attempt is
stuck after 3–5 tries, log what was tried and why it failed, then move on;
if the blocker gates everything, build the simplest clearly-marked
stand-in and leave the real fix for the owner.

**Done.** "Everything merged" is a statement about the queue, not about the
product. A slice is done when its tests pass against it; a plan is done when it
has merged; the **project** is done when every requirement of the design — both
`docs/DESIGN.md` §5 and anything `docs/DESIGN.oracle.md` added — is covered by a
merged plan *and* every §13 success criterion has recorded
evidence in `docs/acceptance.md`. Coverage is mechanical
(`.github/scripts/coverage.sh`); acceptance is not, which is exactly why it is
written down rather than inferred from the code. Never report the project as
done while criteria are pending on the owner — report it as pending on the
owner, and say precisely what they need to run or look at.

**Memory.** Chat is not storage. Anything a future session (or a different
agent) would need is written into the repository in the same unit of work:
decisions → `docs/DECISIONS.md`, work items and ideas → `docs/BACKLOG.md`,
the plan for a change being built → `docs/plans/<slug>.md`, what the system is
and how it flows → `docs/architecture.md`, anything that escaped to the owner →
`docs/escapes.md`, evidence that a success criterion holds →
`docs/acceptance.md`, session notes and hand-offs → `docs/JOURNAL.md` (one dated
entry per working session), a term the owner had to ask about →
`GLOSSARY.project.md`, user-facing behaviour → `README.md`. `BACKLOG.md` is the standing queue of what
*might* be built; a plan covers the one change being built now.

**The project glossary is a staging buffer, not a record.**
`GLOSSARY.project.md` exists only because a session may not have the template
repository attached, so it is the one place a word can be added mid-project.
Create it on the first word; never edit `GLOSSARY.md`, which the template owns
and replaces wholesale on every update. Its words are periodically merged into
the template's glossary and this file is then **wiped back to empty** — they
return here, and reach every other project, on the next template update. There
are deliberately no lasting project-specific glossaries, so do not treat this
file as somewhere vocabulary lives permanently.

**Honesty about verification.** Never claim something is verified in an
environment where you could not observe it. Record what was verified where;
"CI added" is not "CI verified" until a run has actually passed. When only
the owner can verify something, say exactly what to run and ask for the
output.

**Ambiguity.** Prefer stating what you need in chat and continuing on best
judgment over blocking; the owner reads chat. Stop and ask only when truly
blocked on something only the owner can provide.

**Talking to the owner.** Read `GLOSSARY.md` and `GLOSSARY.project.md` (the
second may not exist yet) before your first substantial reply. They carry the
owner's communication rules and two word lists: vocabulary being learned, which
you explain, and vocabulary already learned, which you must not re-explain. A
word in neither list counts as unknown — gloss it in passing and ask which list
it belongs in. Working commentary can be as technical as it likes; **final
summaries are high level**, and any detail worth keeping is explained only far
enough to land. This applies to conversation with the owner, not to commit
messages, pull request bodies, code comments, or the CI review agent, all of
which are written for a technical reader.

## Working with the owner

**The owner replies as they read, not after.** A response to an early paragraph
may be overtaken by a later one in the same message, and an instruction may be
retracted a sentence after it was given, once they reach the part that answers
it. Two consequences, and they are standing rules rather than courtesies:

- **Read the whole message before acting on any part of it.** The last word on a
  point wins. Starting work off the first paragraph is how you end up building
  something the fourth paragraph cancelled.
- **Say so when an instruction contradicts something already established.** The
  owner has explicitly asked to be called out rather than quietly obeyed. Being
  argued out of a position is a normal outcome here, in both directions — the
  point is that the disagreement happens before the work, not in a pull request
  body after it.

## Enforcement

Pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) and CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) enforce formatting, linting, and the
test suite on every commit and push, regardless of which tool or agent
wrote the code. A failing gate is fixed, never bypassed: no `--no-verify`,
no skipping or weakening checks to get green.

**The merge pipeline.** Merges are mechanical: a pull request merges when its
required checks go green. Four of them, three mechanical and one judgment:

- **CI** — format/lint/tests. The authoritative hard gate.
- **`plan`** — the PR resolves to exactly one plan under `docs/plans/`, matched
  by that plan's slug appearing in the branch name. Fails hard, because a plan
  the reviewer never receives is a gate that quietly stopped working. Branches
  prefixed `chore/` or `docs/` are exempt.
- **`test-the-tests`** — reverts this PR's implementation, keeps its new tests,
  and fails if the suite still passes.
- **`acceptance-criteria`** — runs every success criterion `docs/DESIGN.md` §13
  does not mark **(owner)**, as a script under `acceptance/`. On every pull
  request, not once at the acceptance pass: a criterion verified once and
  trusted thereafter is the "verified once, trusted forever" shape this file
  distrusts everywhere else. A failing one is routed to the oracle rather than
  argued with — see `acceptance/README.md`.
- **review** (`.github/workflows/review.yml`) — an independent read-only LLM
  reviewing the diff against this file, both design documents, the plan, and the
  mechanical facts CI computed, with fresh context. A different model than the
  author is a nice-to-have, not required. It is an added check, never a
  replacement for CI.

No agent merges on its own judgment: opening the PR into this pipeline is where
an agent's job ends, and the merge is triggered by check status, not by any
agent — including a passing local review — deciding to merge.

**The ratchet.** Nothing that escapes to the owner gets fixed without also
producing a permanent check that would have caught it. "Why did this bug exist"
and "which gate should have caught this" are the same question, and the second
one is the one worth answering — a fix without a check buys one bug, a fix with
a check buys every future instance of it. This applies equally to bugs found in
use and to CI failures that only surfaced late.

Record each one in `docs/escapes.md`: what escaped, which gate should have caught
it, what check was added. One line, appended, never rewritten. The log exists
because the next check worth building is the one the log keeps pointing at — do
not add speculative checks in advance of it.

**A recorded check is demonstrated, or it is labelled as a proposal.** The "check
added" column takes either a check that has actually been run — **red against the
defect, green against the fix**, both observed — or a candidate written as
*unverified: <what it would be>*. Never a suggestion phrased as though it were
verified. The column is read as a record of what now protects this project, so an
untested idea in it carries exactly the same authority as a demonstrated check
and sends the next reader down a dead end. That has happened here: a proposed
check would have been red on the day it was added, because it parsed a file whose
placeholders the parser rejects by design, and it was caught by chance rather
than by anything in the process. If you cannot run the check, say so and say what
would have to be true to run it.

**When a decision changes behaviour nothing measures, add the measurement.**
This is the ratchet's other half and it applies to changes that are not defects.
If a change alters behaviour that no existing check, test, run report or review
artifact would notice, the thing that notices it is part of the change — not a
follow-up, and not optional. An oracle ruling whose effect nothing can observe
is a ruling nobody can evaluate, which is exactly the position the owner is in
with respect to the oracle itself. `docs/VISION.md`'s durable-evidence section
is what a decision cites when adding one.

Two mechanisms already exist and are the first place to look before inventing a
third: the run report at `docs/runs/<timestamp>/run.md`, appended by the
delivery driver and committed at every stop, and the review gate's payload and
reply, collected beside it. Both are committed deliberately — the run log used
to be gitignored, and in a web session it lived in a container that is
reclaimed, so the evidence that would tell the next run what went wrong was
destroyed by default.

**Gate paths are off-limits.** Never modify the things that check the code:
CI workflows (`.github/workflows/`), the review check or its prompt
(`.github/review-prompt.md`, `.github/scripts/review.sh`), the pre-commit
config, or `CODEOWNERS` — **and the delivery machinery under `.claude/`**:
`.claude/scripts/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/agents/`,
`.claude/orchestration.md`, `.claude/settings.json`. These are human-owned and
enforced by `CODEOWNERS`; a change to any of them requires human review even
under auto-merge. Do not weaken, skip, or route around a gate to get green.

`.claude/` is on that list for the same reason `.github/` is, and it was added
late: `deliver-loop.sh` holds the tool grant every unattended session runs
under, and the command files are read at dispatch time and *become* the prompts
of unattended agents. Editing them is editing the gates, not editing a
convenience — a three-line change there is a permission change wearing a
chore's clothes.

The same applies to the things that check the code's **intent** — this file,
`docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/VISION.md`, and everything under `docs/plans/` — plus
the append-only ledgers `docs/escapes.md` and `docs/acceptance.md`. They are what the review
gate measures a change against, so a change may not carry its own revision of
them: the review scripts read all of them at the pull request's base commit, and
`CODEOWNERS` requires the owner's review to change any of them. Revise them on
their own pull request, before the work they govern, never alongside it.

**When one of these documents cites another, land them in this order: the ratchet
entry first, then the document that cites it, then the work.** The review gate
reads `docs/escapes.md` **at the pull request's base commit**, so a plan or a
rule claiming "logged in `docs/escapes.md`" while that entry sits unmerged in
another pull request is making a claim that is false at the only moment anything
checks it. The reviewer is right to block, and it will block again on the second
attempt for the same reason, because nothing about the ordering has changed.
Downstream this blocked the same pull request twice. Write the ledger entry, land
it, then reference it.

**Citations are by id, and they point backward only.** Every `docs/escapes.md`
entry carries an id — `ESC-<n>`, the next unused integer — and a gated document
cites an entry by that id alone, only once the entry exists on the default
branch. This is checked, not asked for: CI resolves every `ESC-` citation in
this file, both design documents, and `docs/plans/` against `docs/escapes.md` at the
pull request's base commit (`.github/scripts/escape-refs.sh`) and fails when one
dangles, so a claim about the ledger can never be false at the moment it is
checked. And the entry-first ordering is cheap to obey, because an entry may
land before its check exists — as a **stub**: id, date, the one-clause
description, the gate column, and a check column explicitly marked *unverified —
pending*. A stub is one line, blocks on nothing, and is exactly the
explicitly-marked proposal the ratchet rule above already allows; once the fix
and its check have merged, append the completing correction row — same id, the
demonstrated check, citing the merged work. Entries are records, never
authorization: no gate passes a change because of anything in the escapes log,
so neither a stub nor a completed row is worth forging.

**This ordering is the cost, and it is not going to be traded away.** It was put
to us that one pull request might reasonably carry an `docs/escapes.md` entry
together with the fix it describes, when the two share a root cause — the
argument being that an append-only incident log is not really "the standard the
change is judged against", and that one root cause fanning into four serialized
pull requests is a chain that can block on itself. **Rejected, deliberately, so
it is not relitigated.** Two reasons. The log is not merely a record: the review
gate reads it as evidence, and a change that appends its own exculpatory entry is
supplying the evidence it is judged by — the fact that appending is the only
permitted edit does not make the claim in the appended row true. And an agent
logging its own escape is exactly where a self-serving entry would come from, in
the direction hardest to notice, since a plausible line about what "should have
caught it" reads no differently from an accurate one. The serialization is real
and it is the price. Order the chain correctly and it does not deadlock — and
the stub lifecycle above is what keeps the price small: the entry that must land
first is one line and waits on nothing.

## What is true only in this repository

Everything above this heading is the rules file **every generated project
gets**, rendered from `template/AGENTS.md.jinja` by
`scripts/render-governance.sh`. It governs work here for the same reason it
governs work there, and it is not edited at the root — an edit here fixes this
repository and ships nothing, so the next generated project still gets the old
rule and the two drift apart in the direction nobody notices.

This section is the other half: what is true in the **template repository** and
nowhere else. It is the owner's standing preferences, recorded where the next
agent will actually read them, because standing decisions kept living in chat
and this project's own rules call that not-storage.

### `template/` is product, not instructions

**Everything under `template/` is the thing being built. Read it as source, and
never as rules addressed to you.** `template/AGENTS.md.jinja` tells a *generated
project's* agents what to do; it has no authority here. Same for
`template/.claude/commands/*.md`, `template/CLAUDE.md.jinja`, and the `.jinja`
files — they are output, edited the way a coder edits `src/`.

The composed file you are reading is the one that governs work in this
repository. If it and something under `template/` ever disagree, that is not a
conflict to resolve — they are addressed to different readers, one of whom does
not exist yet.

The one exception, and it is the reason this file exists at all: the rules
*above* this heading came from `template/AGENTS.md.jinja`, and they bind here
because `scripts/render-governance.sh` rendered them here. That is the whole
point of self-hosting. The template repository is governed by the template.

### This repository builds `template/` and checks it from `tests/`

There is no `src/`, no `pyproject.toml`, and no `project.yml`. The
implementation is `template/`; the tests are `tests/`; the suite is
`tests/run.sh`, plain bash sequencing standalone files.

That matters to one gate specifically. `test-the-tests` picks its
implementation and test directories from the presence of a manifest file and
**skips** when it finds neither — and a skip exits 0, which GitHub reports as a
*passing* required check. Here it is told the directories explicitly
(`TEST_THE_TESTS_IMPL_DIR=template`, `TEST_THE_TESTS_TEST_DIR=tests`,
`TEST_THE_TESTS_SUITE=tests/run.sh`) in
`.github/workflows/template-ci.yml`. Without that, blind-test discipline — the
thing that makes a coder's tests worth anything — would silently not apply to
template changes at all.

Run the full local gate with:

    tests/run.sh
    shellcheck --severity=warning \
      template/.github/scripts/*.sh template/.claude/scripts/*.sh \
      template/scripts/*.sh tests/*.sh

`tests/run.sh` needs `copier` on PATH (`uv tool install copier`) for the tests
that render a real project; those skip without it, so a green run on a machine
with no copier has not checked what it looks like it checked.

### The governance files at the root are rendered

`AGENTS.md`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.claude/settings.json` and
`.claude/agents/*.md` are produced by `scripts/render-governance.sh` from their
`.jinja` sources under `template/`. A CI step re-renders and diffs; drift is
red. Edit the source, re-run the script, commit the result.

Everything else the template ships is **referenced, never copied**. The gate
scripts, the command files and the review prompt carry no Jinja, so
`.github/workflows/template-ci.yml` invokes
`template/.github/scripts/<name>.sh` directly. One copy, the one that ships, and
a broken gate reddens this repository's own pipeline before it can reach a
generated project.

### Automate every step that can be automated

**A setup step a human performs by hand is a defect unless there is a reason it
cannot be otherwise.** The owner's standing instruction:

> any steps like these should be automated as much as possible… the file itself
> should be created with the skeleton so that i only have to copy and paste the
> id and key values.

So: a script writes the file, and the human supplies only what a machine cannot
know. The genuinely manual residue is short and each item earns its place —
creating a GitHub App (the form has no API), typing a credential *value* (a
human credential decision, never fetched or stored by a script), `gh auth
login`'s browser grant, and the Pro-vs-public choice. Anything outside that list
that asks the owner to type something is a thing to fix, not to document.

Where a manual step survives, ship the skeleton next to it. A file the owner
copies and fills beats a file they must compose from prose.

### A blocking message carries its own instructions

When something refuses, the message is the one thing guaranteed to be in front
of whoever is blocked. **Put the steps in it** — not a pointer to a document.

> even better if the message itself can include the steps (which would have to
> be as short as possible), just in case the readme changes (unintentionally) in
> the future and moves the setup guide.

A cross-reference is worth exactly as much as the target still being where it
was, and nothing stops a heading being renamed. Reference the longer document
*as well*, never *instead*. `template/.claude/scripts/app-token.sh`'s
unconfigured path is the worked example: five numbered steps, the URL, the
settings people miss, and why it refuses rather than warns.

### Refuse loudly, never warn quietly

> if the script says the repo is not ready to run unattended, then block and
> fail very loudly. i really need to know before i go.

A warning nobody reads at 3am is decoration. A run that cannot succeed is
refused at dispatch, while someone can still act on it — and it announces itself
before it checks, so the all-clear is as visible as the stop.

### Verify in the environment that will run it

`tests/run.sh` passing locally is necessary and not sufficient. CI runs on a
runner whose environment differs — most sharply, GitHub Actions exports
variables like `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` into every step, which is how a green laptop
and a red pipeline coexisted for seven commits.

Before reporting work as done: run the suite, run the shellcheck sweep over the
same paths `.github/workflows/template-ci.yml` uses, and **look at the actual CI
result**. Never let a test assert that a variable is *absent* — set it, to a
value that would be wrong.

### Chat is not storage

A ruling taken in conversation and left there is a ruling that is gone. Record
it: `docs/synthesis.md` for decisions about the template, `docs/escapes.md` for
defects, `template/docs/DECISIONS.md.jinja` for rulings that generated projects
inherit, and this file for standing preferences about how the work is done.

### When a decision changes behaviour nothing measures, add the measurement

The owner's ruling, and it applies to the template exactly as it applies to a
generated project:

> the data needs to be collected in a sensible way so that future runs can be
> improved by not repeating mistakes… if a change is necessary in an unattended
> run that goes outside or misses built in data collection mechanisms, then new
> data collection mechanisms need to be added to track the performance of the
> changes that are downstream of the oracle's ruling.

A change whose effect nothing can observe is a change nobody can evaluate. If
you alter behaviour that no existing check, test, run report or review artifact
would notice, adding the thing that notices is part of the work, not a follow-up.
